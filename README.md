First draft of python file for making base of our project of extracting intrested images base on our given prompts like person ,car or food anything which can be searched in the combination of "OR" and "AND" between keywords.
This model works on pretrained model from YOLOv5 of COCO dataset which comprises 80 different objects and 330K images with annotations and bounding boxes.
We would try to make this more precise for what we are giving it prompts which can be understood by the model to give us our intrest of resuts. we would try to add up other models also whic can be give us more precise results by filtering out the 
resulted images based on our prompt meanwhile we also try to work on its front-end.

we used pretrained model for this because this is the best what available for our project(may find more best and useful models as project develops, it is not feasible FOR NOW to train a different model. due to plenty of resoources and time.
we may look at it later. For now we try to compile best tools to make our project.
